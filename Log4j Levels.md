Logging levels are used to categorize the entries in your log file

> You can filter your log files during the search.

> You can manage the amount of information that you log.

Let's consider that as the following rank order for the levels:

## ALL < TRACE < DEBUG < INFO < WARN < ERROR < FATAL < OFF
